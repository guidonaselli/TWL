# Map 1010 - Barrio del Mercado

## Intent
A bustling marketplace district within Puerto Roca. Players come here to trade, visit the auction house (planned), and meet local merchants.

## Connections
- **1000 - Plaza Mayor**: Main entrance to the market.

## Gating
- Accessible from the start, but some merchants might require reputation.

## Tileset Requirements
- Uses standard tropical town tileset.
- **TODO**: Replace placeholder tiles with market stalls, crates, and goods.
