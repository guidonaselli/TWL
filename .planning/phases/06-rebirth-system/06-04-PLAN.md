<objective>
Consolidate Phase 6 with end-to-end verification, rollback safety checks, and cross-system regressions.

Purpose: This closes remaining integration risk so execution can proceed with high confidence and minimal rework.
Output: End-to-end and failure-path test suites proving character and pet rebirth correctness across networking, persistence, and quest gating.

    1. Add end-to-end tests covering rebirth request handling, level reset, stat grant schedule, persistence save/load continuity, and prestige payload visibility.

    2. Extend quest-gating tests with rebirth-level requirement scenarios to ensure rebirth progression integrates with quest start validation.

    3. Include negative tests for requirement-gated rebirth attempts.

    1. Add failure-path tests that force rebirth operation interruptions and assert no partial mutation survives.
