1) RESULT: REPORT
2) SUMMARY:
The provided daily task ("Consistency Auditor Report") is missing the mandatory fields: SCOPE, OUT-OF-SCOPE, DoD, and TESTS. As per the strict rules, implementation is blocked until these are provided.
- Missing: SCOPE, OUT-OF-SCOPE, DoD (Acceptance Criteria), and TESTS/VALIDATIONS definitions.
- Options:
  A) Provide the missing definitions so the quest JSON fixes can be implemented.
  B) Discard this task and provide a new properly formatted task.
- Recommendation: Option A. Update the daily task ticket to include the missing fields so the quest ID and narrative fixes can be safely executed without expanding scope.
3) CHANGES:
- None. Implementation was aborted due to the malformed task ticket.
4) VALIDATION:
- No tests were run as no code changes were made. Verified the structure of the existing `.planning/REPORT.md` and confirmed the absence of the required fields.
5) FOLLOW-UPS:
- Update the GSD Orchestrator task ticket with SCOPE, OUT-OF-SCOPE, DoD, and TESTS.
- Re-run the daily execution agent once the ticket is fully compliant.
