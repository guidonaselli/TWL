# Daily Skills Report - 2026-01-29

## Summary
Implemented the Wind Element skill tree and enhanced the Auto-Battle system with new heuristics.

## Deliverables
1. **Wind Skills Implementation** (`Content/Data/skills.json`):
   - Added 12 new skills across 3 branches (Physical, Magical, Support).
   - **Physical:** Wind Slash I/II/III (Stage evolution), Sonic Blade (Tier 2).
   - **Magical:** Air Blade I/II/III (Stage evolution), Tornado (Tier 2).
   - **Support:** Breeze I/II/III (Agi Buff), Zephyr (Cleanse/Heal).
   - Configured `StageUpgradeRules` for rank-based evolution (Rank 6/12).
   - Configured `StackingPolicy` (RefreshDuration) and `ConflictGroup` (Buff_Agi) for buffs.

2. **Localization** (`TWL.Client/Resources/Strings*.resx`):
   - Added 12 new localization keys (SKILL_WindSlashI, etc.) to both neutral and English resources.

3. **Auto-Battle Heuristics** (`TWL.Server/Simulation/Managers/AutoBattleService.cs`):
   - **Seal Logic:** Added support for `Seal` (Control) skills. Prioritizes high-stat enemies.
   - **Buff Logic:** Added support for `BuffStats` skills. Avoids casting if ally already has the buff.
   - **Priority Update:** Heal > Cleanse > Dispel > Seal > Buff > Attack.

4. **Verification** (`TWL.Tests/Skills/DailySkillsTests.cs`):
   - Validated skill loading and JSON structure.
   - Validated Auto-Battle decision making for Seal and Buff scenarios.
   - Validated logic prevents overwriting existing buffs unnecessarily.

## Technical Details
- **Stage Evolution:** Utilized `StageUpgradeRules` to link Skill IDs. `CombatManager` handles the transition upon mastery rank threshold.
- **Failures Addressed:** Fixed LocalizationAudit failure by syncing `Strings.en.resx`.

## Next Steps
- Address pre-existing test failures in `SkillInfrastructureTests` related to `skills.json` path resolution.
- Implement Earth/Fire/Water detailed trees in future iterations.
