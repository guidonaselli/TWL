# Daily Skills Report - 2024-06-03

## Summary
Expanded the Skills System infrastructure to support Area of Effect (AoE) targeting and Auto-Battle heuristics.

## Delivered
1.  **Infrastructure: Targeting**
    -   Added `ColumnEnemies` and `CrossEnemies` to `SkillTargetType`.
    -   Implemented `SkillTargetingHelper` to resolve targets based on skill definition (Single, All, Row, etc.).
    -   Updated `CombatManager.UseSkill` to support multi-target skills (returns `List<CombatResult>`).

2.  **Infrastructure: Auto-Battle**
    -   Implemented `AutoBattleManager` with deterministic heuristics:
        -   **Survival**: Prioritizes Healing when Ally HP < 30%.
        -   **Support**: Prioritizes Cleansing debuffs.
        -   **Aggression**: Uses strongest available attack (based on SP cost).
    -   Uses `IRandomService` for determinism.

3.  **Refactoring**
    -   Updated `UseSkillCommand` and `UseSkillHandler` to handle `List<CombatResult>`.
    -   Updated core combat tests to reflect these changes.

## Validation
-   Added `SkillTargetingTests` to verify target resolution.
-   Added `AutoBattleManagerTests` to verify decision logic.
-   Verified `CombatManagerTests` passes with new list-based return type.

## Next Steps
-   Implement specific skills utilizing the new AoE types.
-   Refine "Row/Column" targeting when grid positioning is fully implemented.
