# Daily Report - Pets System - 2026-02-02

## Summary
Completed core PETS system implementation including content expansion, revive logic updates, and amity penalty adjustments. Validated via existing and updated test suites.

## Deliverables
1.  **Content Expansion**:
    - Populated `Content/Data/pets.json` with 12 new pets (total 21+), covering Capture, Quest, and Utility types.
    - Added diverse Elements (Earth, Wind, Fire, Water) and Growth Models (Standard, EarlyPeaker, LateBloomer).
    - Fixed Rarity validation issues (Uncommon -> Common/Rare).

2.  **Logic Updates**:
    - **Revive**: Removed Gold cost. Implemented Item consumption logic (Items 801, 802, 803) with variable HP restoration.
    - **Amity**: Reduced death penalty from -10 to -1 per Gameplay Contracts.
    - **ServerPet**: Updated `Revive()` to accept `hpOverride` for partial revives.

3.  **Tests & Infrastructure**:
    - **PetServiceTests**: Updated to test Item consumption instead of Gold. Fixed `Element.None` setup issues.
    - **PetSystemExpansionTests**: Fixed flaky combat mocks and verified Amity reduction logic.
    - **PetContentTests**: Added new validation suite for `pets.json` integrity (Unique IDs, valid Elements).
    - **Fixes**: Resolved `Element.None` exceptions in multiple existing tests (`PetSwitchingTests`, `PetLogicTests`, `ServerPetTests`).

## Status
- **Core System**: Functional and Tested.
- **Content**: Populated (P0 Blocker Resolved).
- **Tests**: All Pet-related tests Passing. (Some unrelated failures remain in Quest/Combat domains).

## Next Steps
- Implement `PetCombatAI` (currently basic/passive).
- Implement `PetRiding` logic in Client/Server sync.
