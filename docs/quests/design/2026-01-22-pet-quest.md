# Design: First Pet - Companero de Viaje (Quests 1008-1010)

> **JULES-CONTEXT**: This document details the pet introduction questline. It is the player's
> first pet acquisition via quest (not capture). The monkey pet is quest-unique and bound
> to the player. Reference: `2026-01-22-intro-arc.md` Quests 1008-1010 for canonical definition.
> Pet data must exist in `pets.json` with matching PetId.

**Quest IDs:** 1008, 1009, 1010
**Mechanic Focus:** Pet system introduction, quest-granted pets, PetUnlockId reward type.

## Design Intent

This 3-quest chain teaches:
1. Exploration leads to discoveries (hearing sounds in the jungle)
2. Kindness and care are rewarded (healing the monkey)
3. Pets are companions, not just combat tools (feeding/bonding)
4. The pet system exists and has ongoing progression (amity)

## Quest Flow

```
1008: Ruidos Extranos (discover the monkey)
  |
  v
1009: Un Nuevo Amigo (heal the monkey)
  |
  v
1010: Companero de Viaje (bond with monkey -> PET UNLOCK)
```

## Implementation Notes

### New Reward Type: PetUnlockId
- `RewardDefinition` must support `PetUnlockId` field
- Server logic in `ClientSession.HandleClaimRewardAsync`:
  1. Check player doesn't already have this pet (idempotency)
  2. Create `PetCharacter` instance from `pets.json` definition
  3. Add to player's pet roster
  4. Set initial Amity to 1
- Client: Show pet unlock animation, open pet panel tutorial

### Quest-Unique vs Capturable
- This pet CANNOT be caught in the wild (Capturable: false)
- It is bound to the player's account
- It cannot be traded or released
- Flag: `UniquePerCharacter: true` on the quest reward

### Future: Pet Bonding Sidequests
After unlocking the monkey, future sidequests can increase Amity:
- Feeding quests (collect specific food items)
- Play/interaction quests
- Combat together milestones
These are defined in `2026-01-22-brisa-island-cont.md`.
